# airpump-control
Software used to control the airpump in our Techbunker.

This Software makes use of:
  - Nanpy
  - Kivy

 Be sure that the dependencies are installed in order to run the program correctly.

 The code runs on a Raspberry Pi with a Arduino hooked up.
 To control the Arduino, Nanpy is installed on the Rpi and flashed onto the Arduino.

This is a clean rewrite of the whole application.
